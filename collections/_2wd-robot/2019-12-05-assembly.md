Assembly of the robot platform and the components.

The acrylic chassis has many holes which allow to mount a mounting plate that can hold different development boards.
It allows also to mount a Raspberry Pi 4 B, which will be used in this project.

The following image shows how I mounted the robot car kit. Notice that I placed the battery compartment on the bottom of 
the acrylic chassis instead of on top of it as suggested in the [instructions manual](https://joy-it.net/files/files/Produkte/robot05/Robot05-Anleitung.pdf) (seems to be only available in german). 
The reason is that I will use an additional USB-C powerbank to power the Raspberry Pi 4 B.

To assemble the robot car kit it is important to mount the motors on the correct side of the acrylic plate becasue otherwise
the mounting plate where the RPi will be attached will not fit to the pre drilled holes.

## Battery Pack

To power the motors the provided battery compartment will be used, which holds four AA batteries $4 \cdot 1.5\text{V} = 6\text{V}$.



## Powerbank for RPi

As mentioned the robot will be equipped with a USB-C powerbank to supply the RPi 4 B with 5 V.
