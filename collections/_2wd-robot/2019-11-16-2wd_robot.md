This project provides guidance on how to build an autonomous 2WD (two wheel dirve) robot. 
The robot is equipped with a [Raspberry Pi 4 B](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/32858825148.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.5d232e8bvlKM7l&algo_pvid=2c45d347-5783-49a6-a0a8-f104d0b78232&algo_expid=2c45d347-5783-49a6-a0a8-f104d0b78232-0&btsid=0100feb4-37d7-453a-8ff8-47a0e2fbdef7&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_9,searchweb201603_52) running [ROS melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic), 
attached sensors and an actuator to let the robot drive itself to its desired location.
To find its way around it uses a camera and an ultrasonic sensor to avoid obstacles. 
The project is split into multiple parts, to adress the following main aspects of the robot.

- Part list and assembly of the robot platform and the components.
- Raspberry Pi 4 B setup using ROS melodic, which will be the brain of the robot.
- System integration: combining the components.
