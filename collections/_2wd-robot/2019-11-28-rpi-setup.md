These are the instructions to setup a custom Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic on Raspberry Pi 4 B.

## Obtain Ubuntu 18.04 ARM Image

To install the long term supported (LTS) Ubuntu 18.04 on the Raspberry Pi 4 B James A. Chambers provides a [blog post](https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-4-ubuntu-server-desktop-18-04-3-image-unofficial/) where
he created a custom image. His unofficial releases can be found in his [github repository](https://github.com/TheRemote/Ubuntu-Server-raspi4-unofficial/releases). 

Download the latest release of the image and flash it to an empty sd card. To do this follow the instructions on the [Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

## Wifi Issues

If you are not in the US it is possible that you encounter connection problems when connected to a 5Ghz Wifi network. If you are in a different country than the US you need to update your regulatory country. 5Ghz needs this to know the right bands to use.

This can be changed by editing the value of `REGDOMAIN` in the file `/etc/default/crda` ([Central Regulatory Domain Agent](https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/developers/regulatory/crda)) to the code for your country [ref](https://github.com/TheRemote/Ubuntu-Server-raspi4-unofficial/issues/98).

## Prepare Ubuntu

After flashing the image to the sd card insert it to the Pi, hook it up to a monitor via HDMI and power it up.
Once logged in (default password is `ubuntu` which needs to be changed after the first login) update Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
Reboot and follow the next steps to install ROS Melodic.


Note that I've provided a bash script for the next steps.
You can clone the repository: https://github.com/fjp/2wd-robot.git and run the ubuntu-setup.bash
