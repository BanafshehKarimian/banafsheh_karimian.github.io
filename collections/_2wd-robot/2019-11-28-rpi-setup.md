These are the instructions to setup a custom Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic on Raspberry Pi 4 B.

## Obtain Ubuntu 18.04 ARM Image

To install the long term supported (LTS) Ubuntu 18.04 on the Raspberry Pi 4 B James A. Chambers provides a [blog post](https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-4-ubuntu-server-desktop-18-04-3-image-unofficial/) where
he created a custom image. His unofficial releases can be found in his [github repository](https://github.com/TheRemote/Ubuntu-Server-raspi4-unofficial/releases). 

Download the latest release of the image and flash it to an empty sd card. To do this follow the instructions on the [Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

## Prepare Ubuntu

After flashing the image to the sd card insert it to the Pi, hook it up to a monitor via HDMI and power it up.
Once logged in (default password is `ubuntu` which needs to be changed after the first login) update Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
Reboot and follow the next steps to install ROS Melodic.
