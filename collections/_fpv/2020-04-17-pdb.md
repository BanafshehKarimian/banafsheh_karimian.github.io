In small copters it is not always possible to provide power via different wiring harness, 
additional devices like [UBEC](/projects/fpv/glossar#ubec) or further voltage regulators.
Instead, in such cases a space-saving component is used, known as 
[Power Distribution Board](/projects/fpv/glossar#power-distribution-board) (PDB) which takes care of distributing the energy
from the battery to all other parts of a copter.
