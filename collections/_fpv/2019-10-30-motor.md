The motors of a copter convert the [electrical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_energy) of 
the [battery](/projects/fpv/glossar/#battery) into [mechanical engergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_energy) that spins the propellors attached to the motor shaft and therefore results in [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy) of the drone. 
With a suitable propellor attached this energy makes it possible to reach speeds up to 130 km/h.

## Electromagnetism

Electric motors of both types, brushed and brushless, use the same principles of 
[electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism) to convert electrical energy into rotation.
If a voltage is applied to a copper wire, a current will flow, which will induce a magnetic field. 
With a permanent magnet near this current-carrying copper wire it is possible to generate linear or rotational forces
to the wire and the magnet. 

## Brushed DC Electric Motor

Some years ago brushed motors were used in rc plane models, which have a big disadvantage.
As the name suggests, brushed dc motors require carbon brushes, which make contact to the rotating rotor to enable 
the flow of current. The brushes of a dc motor are made of graphite which is a wearing part that reduces the efficency.
Another disadvantage are sparks, which can disturb or damage other electrical components. 
Because of the constant stress that these parts have to endure in a multicopter, they would need to be replaced often. 

A brushed dc motor consist of multiple parts, that act together, to create a rotation:
a static part, called the stator, and a rotating part, which is the rotor. 
Permanent magnets with alternating polarity are attached to the stator. 
The rotor also known as armature, which consists of a soft iron core that is wrapped by a copper coil.

</figure>

A current that flows through the coils of the armature produces a [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field) $\vec{B}$, which has a north and a south pole.
The orientation of the poles is in accordance to the direction of the current. 
To achieve a rotation of the rotor the magnetic orientation of the current-carrying coil has to be directed, 
such that the repulsion and attraction of the magnetic fields between stator and rotor generate a permanent rotation.
The problem is to keep the rotation by changing the poles of the copper coils - commutate. 
To achieve this a [commutator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator_(electric)) is used. 
During the rotation of the rotor, its purpose is to switch (commutate) the direction of current flow and therefore 
to change the direction of the magnetic field. This makes the commutator an electrical switch.
The current has to be transfered of a static part onto the rotating commutator, 
where the previously mentioned brushes are used. These are made of graphite and are in light contact with the commutator
through a spring.


## Brushless DC Electric Motor

As the name suggests, brushless dc motors require no wearing brushes for their construction. 
The commutation occurs electrically, not mechanically. 
In this case commutation is the interchange of the current through the coils to make the motor spin. 
The reason that no brushes are necessary for the flow of current, 
is that the change in direction of the current is happening on the stator. 
Therefore the current doesn't have to be transfered to the rotating
rotor, which aleviates the wearing parts - the brushes and the commutator. 
The current-carrying copper coils are wound around the stator sleeve. 
Attached to the rotor bell are permanent magnets in alternating polarity, 
which are often made of [neodymium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neodymium).

Neodymium is a chemical element in the periodic system with the symbol Nd and atomic number 60. 
It belongs to the lanthanide series and is a rare-earth element. Magnets manufactured from this element, count to the strongest magnets on earth.
{: .notice}

For a brushless dc motor to work, it requires three phase wires instead of two in the case of a brushed dc motor.
The three phases carry AC current where each phase is shifted by 120 degrees. This way the current direction and
therefore the direction of magnetic fields are changed, which leads to repulsion and attraction with the permanent magnets that are attached to the rotor.

## Outrunner vs Inrunner

Brushless motors are distinguished into outrunners and inrunners, which defines how they are designed. 
Inrunners have their static part (stator) outside and the rotating part (rotor) inside. 
This principle is the same as found in brushed motors. The opposite is true for an outrunner.
The rotating part lies outside, the fixed part is inside. Outrunners are used for multicopters, 
because of their properties and metrics.

Compared to inrunners, outrunners often have a smaller $K_v$ rating, which is why they rotate slower (lower [rpm](/projects/fpv/glossar/#rpm)) but have a higher [torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque) and don't need a gearbox. Inrunners are far too fast for most aircraft propellers, which is why they are used in conjunction with a gearbox.


## Metrics of a Brushless Motor

When selecting brushless dc motors for a quad the metrics of the motor, such as its dimensions, configuration and $K_v$ ratings are important. Here we see descriptions such as RS2208 and 12N14P. To select the right motor it is crucial to know what
these figures mean. 

### Velocity Constant

One important constant of a motor is the [velocity constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_constants#Motor_velocity_constant,_back_EMF_constant) $K_v$ (not to be confused with kV, the symbol for kilovolt) also known as [back EMF](back EMF) constant. The constant is measured in revolutions per minute (RPM) per volt or radians per volt second [rad/(V⋅s)]:

$$
K_v = \frac{\omega_{\text{no_load}}}{V_{\text{Peak}}}
$$

The $K_{v}$ rating of a brushless motor is the ratio of the motor's unloaded rotational speed (measured in RPM) to 
the peak (not RMS) voltage on the wires connected to the coils (the back EMF). 
For example, an unloaded motor of $K_{v}=5,700\text{rpm}/\text{V} supplied with 11.1 V will run at a nominal speed of 63,270 rpm (5,700 rpm/V × 11.1 V)[[ref]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_constants#Motor_velocity_constant,_back_EMF_constant).

### Motor Sizing

N denotes number of stator "wire wound" poles, P denotes number of rotor "permanent magnet" poles.
