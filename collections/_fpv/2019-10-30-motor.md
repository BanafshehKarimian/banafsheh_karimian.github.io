The motors of a copter convert the [electrical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_energy) of 
the [battery](/projects/fpv/glossar/#battery) into [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy). 
With a suitable propellor attached this energy makes it possible to reach speeds up to $130 km/h$.

## Electromagnetism



## Brushed DC Electric Motor

Some years ago brushed motors were used in rc plane models, which have a big disadvantage.
As the name suggests, brushed dc motors require carbon brushes, which make contact to the rotating rotor to enable 
the flow of current. The brushes of a dc motor are made of graphite which is a wearing part that reduces the efficency.
Another disadvantage are sparks, which can disturb or damage other electrical components. 
Because of the constant stress that these parts have to endure in a multicopter, they would need to be replaced often. 

A brushed dc motor consist of multiple parts, that act together, to create a rotation:
a static part, called the stator, and a rotating part, which is the rotor. 
Permanent magnets with alternating polarity are attached to the stator. 
The rotor looks like an anchor, which consists of a soft iron core that is wrapped by a copper coil.

A current that flows through the coils of the anchor produces a [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field) $\vec{B}$, which has a north and a south pole.
The orientation of the poles is in accordance to the direction of the current. 
To achieve a rotation of the rotor the magnetic orientation of the current-carrying coil has to be directed, 
such that the repulsion and attraction of the magnetic fields between stator and rotor generate a permanent rotation.
The problem is to keep the rotation by switch over - commutate - copper coils.
