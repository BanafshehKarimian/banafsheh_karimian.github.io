The motors of a copter convert the [electrical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_energy) of the [battery]
(/projects/fpv/glossar/#battery) into [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy). 
With a suitable propellor attached this energy makes it possible to reach speeds up to $130 km/h$.
