After selecting all components of a race quad it is time to assemble everything together. 
First, we have to decide where each part will be located in the quad. Therefore,
we assembe the [frame](/projects/fpv/frame) and mount each component to its final location inside the frame.

Several components need to be prepared for the assembly, because they need for example some soldering or heat shrinks applied.


## 1. Motor Mounting


## 2. Assemble ESCs on the Arms 



## 3. Power Distribution Board Assembly

Let's begin preparing the [Power Distribuiton Board](/projects/fpv/glossar/#power-distribution-board). 
We start to tin the PDB pads that are going to power the [ESCs](/projects/fpv/glossar/#esc) 
using four power (red) and ground (black) wires.

## 4. Connect ESCs to the PDB



## 5. Prepare the Flight Controller

First we have to tin the pins of the [Flight Controller](/projects/fpv/glossar/#flight-controller) (FC) that will be used
to connect components such as the control wires of the [ESCs](/projects/fpv/glossar/#esc) and the [FPV System](/projects/fpv/glossar/#fpv).

The FC will be placed above the [PDB](/projects/fpv/glossar/#power-distribution-board).

## 6. VTX Preparation


## 7. Install the Camera and the VTX


## 8. Prepare the Receiver


## 9. Connect the Receiver to the Flight Controller


## 10. Connect the Battery with the PDB
