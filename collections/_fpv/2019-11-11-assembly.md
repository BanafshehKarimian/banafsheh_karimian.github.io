After selecting all components of a race quad it is time to assemble everything together. 
First, we have to decide where each part will be located in the quad. Therefore,
we assembe the [frame](/projects/fpv/frame) and mount each component to its final location inside the frame.

Several components need to be prepared for the assembly, because they need for example some soldering or heat shrinks applied.

## 1. Prepare the Flight Controller

First we have to tin the pins of the [Flight Controller](/projects/fpv/glossar/#flight-controller) (FC) that will be used
to connect components such as the control wires of the [ESCs](/projects/fpv/glossar/#esc) or [FPV System](/projects/fpv/glossar/#fpv).

The FC will be placed above the [PDB](/projects/fpv/glossar/#power-distribution-board).


## 2. Power Distribution Board Assembly

After tinning the FC board, let's take care of the [Power Distribuiton Board](/projects/fpv/glossar/#power-distribution-board)
assembly. Again, we start to tin the PDB pads that are going to power the [ESCs](/projects/fpv/glossar/#esc) 
using four power (red) and ground (black) wires.

## 3. Connect the Battery with the PDB



## 4. Motor Installation



## 5. Fix ESCs on the Arms 

## 6. Connect ESCs to the PDB
