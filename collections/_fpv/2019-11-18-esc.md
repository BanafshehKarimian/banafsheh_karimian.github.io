Compared to a conventional brushed dc motor, which is controlled via its applied voltage, the control of 
a brushless dc motor with its three phase wires requires a dedicated controller. Such a controller is known as
electronic speed controller (ESC). The responsibility of this part is to control the flow of current direction through its
individual output phases that are connected to a brushless dc.

## Workings of a Brushless ESC

Given a desired input signal from the transmitter, an ESC takes over the coordination to correctly control flow of current through the three phase wires of a brushless motor of which the currently set motor position needs to be aquired. 
This can be achieved through two ways: one is to use [Hall effect sensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor) or to make use of the so called counter-electromotive force (also known as [back EMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Back_EMF)). A spinning motor also acts as a generator that generates a force which can be measured by the ESC.
