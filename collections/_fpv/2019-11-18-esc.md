Compared to a conventional brushed dc motor, which is controlled via its applied voltage, the control of 
a brushless dc motor with its three phase wires requires a dedicated controller. Such a controller is known as
electronic speed controller (ESC). The responsibility of this part is to control the flow of current direction through its
individual output phases that are connected to a brushless dc.

## ESC Function

Given a desired input signal from the transmitter, an ESC takes over the coordination to correctly control flow of current through the three phase wires of a brushless motor of which the currently set motor position needs to be aquired. 
This can be achieved through two ways: one is to use [Hall effect sensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor) or to make use of the so called counter-electromotive force (also known as [back EMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Back_EMF)). A spinning motor also acts as a generator that generates a force which can be measured by the ESC.
With this measurement the position of the rotor can be infered. 

A Hall effect sensor can make use of the magnetic interaction of the magnets on the rotor to provide a signal
that evaluates to the position of the rotor. A [receiver](/projects/fpv/glossar/#receiver) or [flight controller (FC)](/projects/fpv/glossar/#fc) commands the the speed of a motor and compares the desired with the target 
speed value. With this speed difference it is possible to adjust the speed to reduce the difference. 

An ESC controls the speed of a motor via pulse witdth modulation (PWM). 
The ESC controls the power supplied from the battery to the motor taking into account the commands of a flight controller or a receiver. For example, an ESC can be targeted to provide 50% of the maxium possible power to its connected motor.
PWM controls the rate at which power is fed from the power source (battery) to the load (motor). 
For example, given that the PWM rate for 100% motor power is 50 kHz, an ESC which should operate the motor at 50% power
will provide the full battery power at a 25 kHz rate.
