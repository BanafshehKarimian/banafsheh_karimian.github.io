Compared to a conventional brushed dc motor, which is controlled via its applied voltage, the control of 
a brushless dc motor with its three phase wires requires a dedicated controller. Such a controller is known as
electronic speed controller (ESC). This part is responsible for controlling the flow of current direction through its
individual output phases that are connected to a brushless dc.
