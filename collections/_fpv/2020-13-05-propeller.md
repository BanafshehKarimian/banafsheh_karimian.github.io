A race quad-copter requires propellers to translate the stored energy of the battery into kinematic energy.
The structure of propellers are comparable to the wings of an airplane, which provides uplift when moving forward
and lifts the plane off the ground.

The propeller causes a similar effect with the difference that not the whole plane needs to move forward.
Instead, the uplift is created through the rotation of the propeller similar to a helicopter.

## Plastic, Fiberglass or Carbon

Propellers can consisto of different materials.
