This project provides guidance on how to build an autonomous two wheel differential drive robot. 
The robot is equipped with a [Raspberry Pi 4 B](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/32858825148.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.5d232e8bvlKM7l&algo_pvid=2c45d347-5783-49a6-a0a8-f104d0b78232&algo_expid=2c45d347-5783-49a6-a0a8-f104d0b78232-0&btsid=0100feb4-37d7-453a-8ff8-47a0e2fbdef7&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_9,searchweb201603_52) running [ROS melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic), 
attached sensors and an actuator to let the robot drive autonomously to a desired location.
To find its way around it uses a camera and an ultrasonic sensor to avoid obstacles. 
Speed sensors combined with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) are used for localization.
The project is split into multiple parts, to adress the following main aspects of the robot.

- [Part list](/projects/diffbot/components/) 
- [Assembly](/projects/diffbot/assembly/) of the robot platform and the components.
- Raspberry Pi 4 B setup using ROS melodic, which will be the brain of the robot.
- System integration: combining the components.
