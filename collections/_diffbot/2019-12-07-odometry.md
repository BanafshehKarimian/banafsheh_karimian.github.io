ROS packages for ROS Melodic related to [odometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometry) running on a Raspberry Pi 4 B for an autonomous 2WD Robot.

The following section describes the theory of robotic motion and odometry, which is part of the book [Elements of Robotics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-62533-1). Here the relevant part for the speed sensors, attached to the robot wheels, is outlined. After going through the theory, we will look at the packages used for ROS. These will be self written ones and the differential drive ROS packages, which is already available.
