After Digital Dream Labs aquired the Vector Robot from Anki the following steps had to be done to get Vector back to fully functioning.

Note that I backed the Kickstarter Campaign: [Vector Unleashed](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digitaldreamlabs/vector-unleashed?). 
If you didn't then you will probably have to buy a license to get all the features working and the latest updates.

For me it was required to

1. [Erase User Data](https://support.digitaldreamlabs.com/article/112-how-to-reset-erase-and-restore-vector#h_542474264551539948167887)
2. Reset Vector by brining it in [Recovery Mode](https://support.digitaldreamlabs.com/article/112-how-to-reset-erase-and-restore-vector#h_279886715391539948161727)


I then was able to use the iOS App to restore Vector, following its instructions.

Another possible way to connect to Vector from a Computer that is running Chrome is to use the [`vector-web-setup`](https://github.com/digital-dream-labs/vector-web-setup).

To enable bluetooth in Chrome or Chromium enter the following:

```
chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features
```

Then enable `Experimental Web Platform features` and restart the browser.
To use `vector-web-setup` install nodejs in Ubuntu 20.04:

```
sudo snap install node --classic --channel=14
sudo snap refresh node --classic --channel=14
```

After getting Vector working again together with the App you can continue to work with the Anki Vector SDK.


## Setup Anki Vector SDK

- You have completed the Installation steps, found here: [Initial Setup](https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/initial.html#initial)
- You have downloaded and extracted the example programs, found in the [`vector-python-sdk` GitHub repository](https://github.com/anki/vector-python-sdk/tree/master/examples)
- The Vector companion app is not currently connected to Vector.
- Vector is connected to the same network as your computer.
- You can see Vectorâ€™s eyes on his screen.
