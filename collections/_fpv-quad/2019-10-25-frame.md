## The Frame and its Components

The frame of a race drone is not only important to house all the individual components of a drone, 
its aerodynamics play a significant role for speed and flight stability.

### Frame Composition

For multicopters many frames exist, that are made up of different pieces and are assembled differently.
The most larger drones commonly consist of a centerplate as their core, arms also known as booms, that hold motors at their ends and the landing gear.
