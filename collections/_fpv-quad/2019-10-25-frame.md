## The Frame and its Components

The frame of a race drone is not only important to house all the individual components of a drone, 
its aerodynamics play a significant role for speed and flight stability.

### Frame Composition

For multicopters many frames exist, that are made up of different pieces and are assembled differently.
Most larger drones commonly consist of a centerplate as their core, arms also known as booms, that hold motors at their ends, and the landing gear. Depending on the size of the motors, dedicated motor mounts are used at the booms to fix the motors. In the field of FPV race quad frames consist of a single centerplate which includes the arms.
This means no weaknesses due to screw connections and a lighter frame.

Nevertheless additional parts exist that are attached to the centerplate, 
such as mounting constructions and cover plates including screws and distance bolts. 
These parts are required for the other essential components such as the [Flightcontroller](/fpv/glossar#flightcontroller), 
[battery](/fpv/glossar#battery) or [FPV-camer](/fpv/glossar#fpv-camera). 
With these mounting material the parts are kept at specific frame locations and are protected from a possible crash.

### Materials

During a flight a FPV frame needs to withstand heavy strain and high [g-forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force). 
Because of this most permium frames consist of an extremely light and stable [carbon fiber reinforced polymer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fiber_reinforced_polymer),
also known as [CFK](/fpv/glossar#cfk).
